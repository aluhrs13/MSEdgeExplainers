      Explainers are documents focused on describing a user/ developer/ customer problem (at a high level) and exploring
      potential solutions. These documents are starting points for engaging in discussion with you and other members of
      the community. Explainers should address their stated problems in clear and easy to understand language. Proposed
      solutions should be easy to follow and not too deep in technical details. When you read an explainer, we hope the
      stated problem is compelling and you can form an opinion for whether the proposed solution would address the
      problem.

      <h3>Please provide feedback</h3>
      We are looking for feedback! Are the stated problems relevant to you? How have they impacted your experience? Do
      the proposed solutions seem reasonable? Do they follow good web principles? Would they solve a problem you
      currently have? (We love to hear that; tell us more about your scenario!) Do you have related use-cases we hadn't
      considered?

      We appreciate you taking the time to offer feedback; it helps to improve the explainers, validate the problem and
      solutions they describe, and show evidence that there is potential momentum to move an idea to the next stage. We
      desire to see all our explainers make the journey to become cross-browser supported web standards.

      Start a new issue here, or join in the discussion on existing issues. We also welcome PRs on the explainer
      documents themselves. Note: we use labels to filter the issues to specific explainers.

      <h3>Have a product bug?</h3>
      If you're looking to file a product bug on Microsoft Edge and the bug is unique to Edge, please use the in-browser
      "Send Feedback" tool (Alt+Shift+i in Windows, or "..." > "Help and feedback"). If the bug reproduces in another
      Chromium-based browser, please file the issue upstream in the Chromium bug database. Thanks!

      <h2>Active ðŸ“£</h2>
      <p>These are the proposals we are currently investigating in this repo. Use the links below to read the
        explainers, review the current issues, and file new issues specifically for the given explainer(s). We hope they
        will all "graduate" and begin their journey along the standards-track as they gain sufficient interest; each
        explainer has a "status of this document" section that indicates what standards venue they expect to go to next
        (if known). When they graduate, we move them into the <a href="alumni">alumni section</a>.</p>

      <h2>Brainstorming ðŸ§ </h2>
      <p>These are proposals that are still really early in their lifecycle. We might just be thinking about the
        problems, starting to get rough ideas of what solutions might look like, or just want to throw an idea out to
        the world to see if there's more people with similar problems. Once we get a handle on the possible solutions
        and directions we'll move these to the "Active Explainers" section above.</p>
